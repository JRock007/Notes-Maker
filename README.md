# Notes Maker

Notes maker is a simple text editor made in python using the PyQt library.
It has all the basic features of a text editor, like text color, different fonts and sizes and more.
However, it also has a unique feature: it allows you to input a list of abbreviations you use (saved in a json file), and it will automagically replace all of them for you in 2 clicks.

This app is based on the following tutorial:
